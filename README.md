# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project uses *K-Means Clustering* to segment a customer dataset into 5 distinct groups based on demographics and behavior. The goal is to identify patterns in age, income, and spending to drive targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Insights
* *Demographics:* The customer base is 56% Female and 44% Male.
* *Core Age:* The most common age group is between 30 and 35 years old.
* *Income & Spending:* Most customers earn between $70k–$80k, with spending scores typically peaking in the moderate range (40–60).

## Clustering Results
Using the *Elbow Method, we determined that **5 clusters* provide the optimal balance for segmentation.

### Customer Segments:
* *Valuable (Largest Group):* Over 80 customers; the core of the business.
* *Elite & Standard:* Mid-to-high level tiers for engagement.
* *Careful & Most Valuable:* Niche segments representing high-income/low-spenders and top-tier loyalists.

## Business Recommendations
1. *Loyalty Focus:* Target the "Valuable" segment with repeat-purchase rewards to maintain volume.
2. *Upsell High-Potentials:* Offer exclusive access to the "Elite" and "Most Valuable" groups.
3. *Age-Targeted Marketing:* Align digital campaigns with the 30–35 age demographic.

## Technologies Used
* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Scikit-learn (K-Means Clustering)
* Jupyter Notebook
